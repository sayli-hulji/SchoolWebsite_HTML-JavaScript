# SchoolWebsite_HTML-JavaScript
This project is developed with the concept of schools/colleges having their own professional and business websites. Students get the idea of developing useful college and school sites for their skill orientation.
This project is the complete website of a school specification where you can find lots of news regarding the facilities, events, activities, and so on. The user interface is attractive with a normal screen design so that users can easily search and fetch data. It is a responsive website, where one can drop in some doubts and queries.
